<h5>Notes:</h5><br><p>
This project uses Flask's debug mode for development. Remember to turn it off for production.
No actual login validation is implemented; you'd need to add user authentication if this were to be used in a real-world scenario.
Templates use Jinja2 syntax for dynamic content insertion.</p>

Feel free to expand on this project by adding more routes, implementing actual user authentication, or enhancing the UI.
